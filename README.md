# üì¶ Dependabot Pull Request Action

This action is based on [koj-co/dependabot-pr-action](https://github.com/koj-co/dependabot-pr-action)

A GitHub Action to automatically label, approve, and merge pull requests made by Dependabot. This was built because the auto-merge feature was removed when Dependabot became a native-GitHub feature.

[![Build CI](https://github.com/mitto98/dependabot-automerge-action/workflows/Release%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/koj-co/dependabot-pr-action/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+CI%22)

## ‚≠ê Get started

You can run this workflow, for example, two times a day:

```yaml
name: Automerge dependabot pr

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 7,12 * * *'

jobs:
  automerge:
    name: Auto-merge patch updates
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: mitto98/dependabot-automerge-action@master
        with:
          token: ${{ github.token }}
          merge-patch: true
```

Setting `merge-prerelease` causes all the prerelease pr to be merged and all the lower level pr. Ex: If `merge`is set to `minor`, the script will merge `minor` and `patch` pr. Setting `merge-prerelease` to `true` will merge `preminor` and `prepatch` too.

- If you set any `auto-label` parameter to `true`, the release type (major, minor, etc.) label will be added to the pull request automatically, if all checks have passed
- If you set any `merge` parameter to `true`, the resulting pull request will be auto-merged, if all checks have passed
- If you set any `approve` parameter to `true`, the pull request will be automatically approved (with a pull request review), if all checks have passed

If you don't want to check for status checks, you can set the input `ignore-status-checks` to `true`. You can also set the `merge-commit` input if you want a custom merge commit message.
